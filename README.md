This is this a real time chat application. 
For the frontend, I used EJS, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.
For the backend, Express.js is used along with popular middlewares like

1. bcrypt for encryption
2. cookie-parser for session management using cookie
3. dotenv for managing environment variables
4. express-validator for validation
5. http-errors to create custom errors when needed
6. jsonwebtoken for authentication
7. multer for file uploads
8. socket.io for real time communication
etc...

For database, I used Mongodb with mongoose as the ORM.

The architecture of followed in this project is MVC.

This is my first full stack project and one of the most important step towards my journey of becoming a MERN stack developer.
